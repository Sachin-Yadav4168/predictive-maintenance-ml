"Predicting industrial component failures using ML (Logistic Regression + SMOTE for rare events)"

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict industrial component failures based on sensor data.  
It uses **Logistic Regression with SMOTE** to handle class imbalance and identifies key drivers of failures.
